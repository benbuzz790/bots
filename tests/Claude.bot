It's nice to meet you! \n\nI'm here to help with a wide variety of tasks - whether you'd like to have a conversation, ask questions, work on a project, brainstorm ideas, or anything else I can assist with. \n\nWhat's on your mind today? Is there something specific you'd like to talk about or explore together?",

Are we building out a conversation tree, exploring different narrative paths, or perhaps mapping out some kind of decision structure?\n\nI'm ready to follow along with whatever framework you're establishing. Should I respond as if we're now at \"Leaf 1A\" in some scenario, or are you setting up multiple branches and leaves to explore different conversational directions?\n\nWhat happens at Leaf 1A?",
