# Issue #160: python_edit duplicate detection - COMPLETED

## Problem
The python_edit tool did not warn users when adding duplicate class/method/function definitions, 
which could lead to confusing code with multiple definitions of the same name.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created helper function `_extract_definition_names()`
- Extracts all top-level class and function names from a CST module
- Returns a list of definition names

### 2. Created duplicate detection function `_check_for_duplicates()`
- Checks for duplicate definitions at file level (classes and functions)
- Checks for duplicate methods when inserting into a class scope
- Returns a warning message if duplicates are found, None otherwise

### 3. Integrated into `python_edit()`
- Duplicate detection runs when using `coscope_with` parameter (insertions)
- Does not run for replacements (intentional overwrites)
- Warning message is prepended to the success message

## Test Coverage
Created comprehensive test file: `tests/integration/test_python_edit/test_duplicate_detection_issue160.py`

Tests cover:
1. ✓ Duplicate class detection at file level
2. ✓ Duplicate function detection at file level  
3. ✓ Duplicate method detection within a class
4. ✓ No false positives for different names

All tests pass with pytest.

## Example Output
Before fix:
```
Code inserted at end of 'test.py'.
```

After fix:
```
Warning: Adding duplicate definition(s): MyClass. This will create multiple definitions with the same name. Code inserted at end of 'test.py'.
```

## Definition of Done: ✓ COMPLETE
- [x] Issue reproduced in test
- [x] Duplicate detection implemented
- [x] Warning messages display correctly
- [x] All test cases pass
- [x] No false positives for different names
