In _work_orders/WO012_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md around lines 1 to 92 the file
contains mis-encoded glyphs (e.g., "Γ£à", "", "", "ΓåÆ"); re-save the file as
UTF-8 and replace all mis-encoded sequences with the intended characters (e.g.,
"Γ£à" → "✅", stray control chars like backspace/formfeed → remove or replace
with appropriate whitespace, "ΓåÆ" → "→" or "→/—" as context requires). Use a
UTF-8 aware editor or run a script (e.g., grep to find occurrences and a batch
replace) to normalize all occurrences, then verify rendering in the repo and
confirm no accidental alterations to content or markdown structure before
committing.

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #2 ===
In TESTING.md around lines 276 to 284, the "Total Tests: 809" value conflicts
with the PR summary stating "775 tests collected"; update the total to "Total
Tests: 775" to match the PR summary and run a quick sanity check of any
dependent numbers (pass rate or per-category counts) to ensure no other values
need adjustment.

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #3 ===
In TESTING.md around lines 287 to 288, the "Last updated" date is currently a
placeholder "2025-01-XX"; replace it with the actual date in YYYY-MM-DD format
(for example "2025-01-15") so the file shows a finalized last-updated timestamp.

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #4 ===
In tests/e2e/conftest.py around line 8, there is a duplicate "import pytest"
statement; remove the redundant import on line 8 so only the original import on
line 3 remains, leaving the file with a single pytest import to satisfy Ruff
(F811).

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #5 ===
In tests/e2e/conftest.py around lines 11 to 14, the hook currently marks every
collected item as belonging to the "cli_serial" group; change it to only mark
items whose file path indicates they are in the test_cli directory (e.g., check
item.fspath or item.nodeid for "test_cli" or the specific path segment), and add
the pytest.mark.xdist_group("cli_serial") marker only when that condition is
true so other e2e tests remain parallelizable.

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #6 ===
In tests/unit/test_helpers.py around lines 118-119 (also apply same change at
136-137, 163-164, 188-189, 212-213, 227-228), remove the duplicate consecutive
@pytest.mark.unit decorators so each test function has only one
@pytest.mark.unit. Alternatively, if preferred, add a single module-level
pytestmark = pytest.mark.unit at the top of the file and delete all per-function
@pytest.mark.unit decorators to keep consistency with other test files.

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #7 ===
tests/unit/test_mock_bot.py lines 10-11 (and duplicates at 38-39, 72-73,
101-102, 138-139, 184-185): remove the repeated @pytest.mark.unit decorators on
each test function and instead add a single module-level @pytest.mark.unit at
the top of the file; ensure each duplicated decorator pair is reduced to no
decorators on the individual tests (or a single one if any test currently lacks
it), and place one @pytest.mark.unit directly above the first import or top of
the file so all tests inherit the marker.

=== CodeRabbit Prompt #8 ===
In tests/unit/test_python_tools.py around lines 17 to 18, the module lacks the
pytest unit marker so tests under tests/unit won't be selected with pytest -m
unit; add a module-level marker by assigning pytestmark = pytest.mark.unit at
the top of the file (after the imports) so the file is marked as a "unit" test
module and will be included when running the unit marker.
