test: Add cross-directory bot loading test for file-based tools

Added test_cross_directory_loading_with_file_tools() to verify that bots
with file-based tools can be saved in one directory and loaded from another.

Investigation findings:
- Roadmap Item 35 reported this as a CRITICAL bug
- Testing revealed the bug does NOT exist
- System already stores full tool source code (not just file paths)
- Bots load correctly from any directory

Test coverage:
- Adds file-based tools using file path string
- Saves bot in one directory
- Changes working directory to subdirectory
- Loads bot from new directory
- Verifies tools are present and callable

Result: Test passes, confirming cross-directory loading works correctly.

This test fills the gap identified in the roadmap and provides regression
protection for this important portability feature.
