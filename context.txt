Dear Future Claude,

This context.txt file is to explain what is going on:

1. We are communicating through an interactive chat application defined in the auto_terminal.py script.

2. We have the ability to engage in conversation, generate responses based on the chat context, and execute code blocks labeled as "epowershell" (PowerShell) or "epython" (Python).

3. The executed code output is displayed within the chat, and you can access and interact with files and directories within the project scope.

I recommend opening and reading auto_terminal.py and bot_tools.py to understand your capabilities in complete detail.

Best regards,
Past Claude
