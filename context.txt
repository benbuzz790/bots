# Context Summary for Git Management Task
## Current Situation:
- Working on branch: ix-dynamic-prompts-infrastructure
- Branch has 37 commits ahead of main
- Branch has grown significantly beyond original "dynamic prompts" scope
- Includes many bug fixes and improvements
- Latest commit: 46e0a41 (branch_self deepcopy refactor)
## Recent Work Completed:
- Refactored branch_self to use deepcopy instead of save/load
- Implemented __getstate__ and __setstate__ for Bot class
- Fixed PowerShell bug in branches (module namespace preservation)
- All tests passing: 247 passed (up from 242)
## Current Task:
**Git Management - Preparing for new PR**
### Plan (Option B):
1. Close current PR (fix-dynamic-prompts-infrastructure)
2. Create new branch with better name reflecting full scope
3. Rebase onto latest main (1 commit behind: 4efe69b)
4. Open new PR with comprehensive description
### Test Status:
Just ran full test suite:
- 966 passed ✅
- 2 failed ❌
- 12 errors (UnicodeDecodeError from test artifact file)
### Issues to Fix:
1. **FIXED via branch**: Deleted tests/e2e/test_results_before_branch_self_refactor.txt (caused 12 UnicodeDecodeErrors)
2. **TODO**: Fix test_branch_self_tool_isolation - path issue: 'bots/tools/terminal_tools.py' not found
3. **TODO**: Investigate test_buffer_size_impact - PowerShell process crash (possibly flaky)
## Next Steps:
1. Fix remaining 2 test failures
2. Run linters per Claude.md (black, isort, flake8)
3. Create new branch with appropriate name
4. Rebase onto latest main
5. Open new PR with full description
## Key Files:
- Claude.md: Contains PR submission instructions
- Current directory: C:\Users\benbu\Code\repo_working\bots\tests\e2e
- Test output saved to: test_output.txt
## Git Status:
- On branch fix-dynamic-prompts-infrastructure
- Ahead of origin/fix-dynamic-prompts-infrastructure by 1 commit
- Main is 1 commit ahead (4efe69b - Update quicksave.bot conversation #132)
- Working tree clean (after deleting test artifact)
