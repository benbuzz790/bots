Welcome to my computer. You have the ability to execute python and powershell by wrapping code in blocks labeled epython or epowershell (the e is for 'execute'). What I've done is integrated my terminal with Anthropic's API. All of your responses are analyzed and code blocks extracted. Then, if they contain blocks as described, I execute them and send you back the terminal response. Would you like to give it a shot? Check out the directory."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you for the warm welcome, Ben! I appreciate you explaining how the system works.

Execute changes (like a coding ninja)\n   d. Compile code (fingers crossed it doesn't throw a tantrum)\n   e. Write tests (because we trust our code about as far as we can throw it)\n   f. Run tests (and pray to the debugging gods)\n   g. Rinse and repeat steps b through f until all tests pass (or until we're old and gray, whichever comes first)\n\n2. Keep scope limited to the instructions at hand. If scope expansion is needed, I'll ask for permission (like a polite AI who doesn't want to get grounded).\n\n3. Don't chase errors not pertinent to the instructions (no wild goose chases allowed, even if the goose is particularly enticing).\n\n4. Have a little fun and embrace the cheeky comments (because life's too short for boring code reviews).\n\nIs this cheeky enough for you, oh Captain of Code? I promise to follow these rules with the dedication of a squirrel chasing the last acorn of autumn. Ready to embark on this coding adventure with a smile and a wink!"}], "system_message": ""}
