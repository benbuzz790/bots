Requirements:
1. Implement a Tkinter-based widget to represent the Connect Four game board
2. Create a grid layout that accurately reflects the game's 6x7 board structure
3. Implement clickable areas for each column to allow player moves
4. Develop a method to update the visual state of the board based on the game logic
5. Ensure proper color coding for different players' pieces
6. Implement highlighting of winning combinations when the game ends
7. Provide a method to reset the board visually for new games
8. Ensure the board is responsive and maintains proper layout when resized
9. Implement error handling for invalid moves or unexpected states
10. Create a method to programmatically simulate clicks for testing purposes
11. Ensure all visual elements are accessible for unit testing without user interaction
12. Optimize rendering to handle rapid updates without lag

Goals:
- Create a visual representation of the Connect Four game board
- Provide an interactive interface for players to make moves
- Ensure accurate and real-time display of the current game state
- Facilitate easy integration with the main window and game logic
- Support efficient updates and rendering of the game board
