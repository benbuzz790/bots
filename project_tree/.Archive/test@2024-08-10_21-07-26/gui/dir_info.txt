Requirements:
1. Implement a main GUI file (e.g., 'main_window.py') using a lightweight Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter).
2. Create a game board visualization that accurately represents the current game state, updating in real-time.
3. Implement clickable areas for player moves, translating GUI interactions to game logic calls.
4. Develop a status display for showing game information (current player, winner) without using pop-ups.
5. Ensure all GUI elements are testable without user interaction, using timeouts <1 second for any elements requiring dismissal during testing.

Goals:
The 'gui' directory is responsible for creating and managing the graphical user interface of the Connect Four game. It aims to provide a simple yet functional visual representation of the game, ensuring a smooth user experience while maintaining testability without user interaction. The GUI should be lightweight and adhere to the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.
