File Name: C:\Users\Ben Rinauto\Documents\Code\llm-utilities-git\llm-utilities\.experiments\test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\gui\main_window.py

Requirements:
1. Implement the main application window using Tkinter
2. Create and manage instances of GameBoard and StatusDisplay
3. Handle user input for starting a new game, making moves, and quitting
4. Implement a game loop that updates the GUI based on the current game state
5. Provide methods for programmatically interacting with the GUI for testing purposes
6. Ensure all GUI elements can be tested without user interaction
7. Implement timeouts (<1 second) for any elements requiring dismissal during testing
8. Integrate with the Game class from the src directory to manage game logic
9. Implement error handling for invalid user inputs or unexpected game states
10. Ensure the window is resizable and maintains proper layout on resize

Goals:
- Serve as the main entry point for the Connect Four game's graphical user interface
- Coordinate the interaction between different GUI components and the game logic
- Provide a clean and intuitive interface for players to interact with the game
- Ensure the GUI is lightweight, responsive, and easily testable
- Maintain a modular structure to facilitate easy updates and maintenance

import tkinter as tk
from typing import Optional

    def __init__(self):
        pass

        pass

    def quit_game(self) -> None:
        pass

    def update_gui(self) -> None:
        pass
