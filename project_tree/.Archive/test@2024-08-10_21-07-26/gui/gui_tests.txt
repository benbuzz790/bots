Requirements:
1. Implement unit tests for MainWindow, GameBoard, and StatusDisplay classes
2. Create test cases that cover all public methods of GUI components
3. Develop tests to verify proper initialization and reset of GUI elements
4. Implement tests for game state updates and their reflection in the GUI
5. Create test cases for error handling and edge cases in GUI interactions
6. Develop tests to verify proper resizing and layout behavior of GUI components
7. Implement tests for color schemes and visual representations of game pieces
8. Create test cases for simulated user interactions (clicks, inputs)
9. Develop tests to verify proper timeout behavior for dismissible elements
10. Implement tests for the integration between GUI components and game logic
11. Create test cases to verify the accuracy of displayed game information
12. Develop tests for accessibility features and keyboard navigation
13. Implement performance tests to ensure smooth GUI updates and rendering
14. Create test cases for multi-game scenarios and score tracking
15. Ensure all tests can run without user intervention and complete within a reasonable time frame

Goals:
- Provide comprehensive unit tests for all GUI components
- Ensure the GUI functions correctly without user interaction
- Validate the integration between GUI components and game logic
- Verify the responsiveness and proper behavior of GUI elements
- Facilitate automated testing of the entire GUI system
