Implement a main GUI file (e.g., 'main_window.py') using a lightweight Python GUI library (e.g., Tkinter).\n2. Create a game board visualization that accurately represents the current game state, updating in real-time.\n3. Implement clickable areas for player moves, translating GUI interactions to game logic calls.\n4. Develop a status display for showing game information (current player, winner) without using pop-ups.\n5. Ensure all GUI elements are testable without user interaction, using timeouts <1 second for any elements requiring dismissal during testing.\nLocal goals: The 'gui' directory is responsible for creating and managing the graphical user interface of the Connect Four game. It aims to provide a simple yet functional visual representation of the game, ensuring a smooth user experience while maintaining testability without user interaction. The GUI should be lightweight and adhere to the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.\n\nProject Interfaces:\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\\src\\game.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom board import Board\nfrom player import Player\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self, players: List[Player]):\n        pass\n\n    def start_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, player: Player, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def check_win(self) -> Tuple[bool, Player]:\n        pass\n\n    def check_draw(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def is_game_over(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def reset_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def get_current_player(self) -> Player:\n        pass\n\n    def get_board_state(self) -> Board:\n        pass\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\\src\\board.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple, Optional\n\nclass Board:\n    def __init__(self, rows: int = 6, columns: int = 7):\n        pass\n\n    def place_piece(self, column: int, player: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def is_column_full(self, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_board_state(self) -> List[List[int]]:\n        pass\n\n    def is_board_full(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_cell_state(self, row: int, column: int) -> Optional[int]:\n        pass\n\n    def reset_board(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def get_dimensions(self) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n        pass\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\\src\\player.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Optional\n\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, name: str, piece: int, is_ai: bool = False, difficulty: str = \"easy\"):\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, board_state: List[List[int]]) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def validate_move(self, column: int, board_state: List[List[int]]) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def reset_player(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def get_name(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\n    def get_piece(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def is_ai_player(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_score(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def get_move_history(self) -> List[int]:\n        pass\n\n    def set_difficulty(self, difficulty: str) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def get_difficulty(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\nParent: test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\nParent Requirements: \n        1.

Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
