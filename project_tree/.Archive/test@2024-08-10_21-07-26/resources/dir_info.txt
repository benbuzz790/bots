Directory Name: C:\Users\Ben Rinauto\Documents\Code\llm-utilities-git\llm-utilities\.experiments\test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\resources

Requirements:
1. Include basic image files for game pieces (e.g., red and yellow circles) in PNG format, each no larger than 5KB.
2. Provide a simple configuration file (e.g., 'config.json') for game parameters such as board size and colors, limited to essential settings only.
3. Create a 'README.md' file listing all resources and their purposes for easy reference, not exceeding 50 lines.
4. Ensure the total size of all resources combined does not exceed 100KB.
5. Limit the number of files in this directory to no more than 10, including the README.md.

Goals:
The 'resources' directory serves as a centralized location for storing non-code assets essential to the Connect Four game. This includes minimal graphical elements and configuration files required for the game's functionality and appearance. The goal is to keep these assets organized and easily accessible to both the core game logic and GUI components while maintaining the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.
