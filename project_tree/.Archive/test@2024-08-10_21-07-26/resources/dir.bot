Include basic image files for game pieces (e.g., red and yellow circles) in PNG format, each no larger than 5KB.\n2. Provide a simple configuration file (e.g., 'config.json') for game parameters such as board size and colors, limited to essential settings only.\n3. Create a 'README.md' file listing all resources and their purposes for easy reference, not exceeding 50 lines.\n4. Ensure the total size of all resources combined does not exceed 100KB.\n5. Limit the number of files in this directory to no more than 10, including the README.md.\nLocal goals: The 'resources' directory serves as a centralized location for storing non-code assets essential to the Connect Four game. This includes minimal graphical elements and configuration files required for the game's functionality and appearance. The goal is to keep these assets organized and easily accessible to both the core game logic and GUI components while maintaining the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.\n\nProject

Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
