Requirements:
1. Implement a Player class to represent game participants (human or AI).
2. Create attributes for player identification (e.g., name, piece color/number).
3. Implement a method for human players to make a move (select a column).
4. Develop a basic AI algorithm for computer players to generate moves.
5. Include a method to validate moves before they are submitted to the game.
6. Implement error handling for invalid moves or unexpected inputs.
7. Create a method to reset or initialize player state for new games.
8. Develop a simple interface for querying player information (e.g., score, move history).
9. Implement a basic difficulty setting for AI players (e.g., random moves vs. strategic moves).
10. Include unit tests to verify player logic, move generation, and AI functionality.
11. Ensure the file does not exceed 100 lines of code, focusing on essential functionality.
12. Design the Player class to be easily extendable for future AI improvements or player types.

Goals:
The 'player.py' file is designed to manage player-related functionality in the Connect Four game. It aims to encapsulate player attributes, move generation, and basic AI logic for computer opponents. This module provides a clear interface for player interactions with the game, handling both human and AI players. The goal is to create a flexible and extensible player system that can easily accommodate different player types and strategies while maintaining simplicity for the proof-of-concept level project.

Interface:
from typing import List, Optional

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name: str, piece: int, is_ai: bool = False, difficulty: str = "easy"):
        pass

    def make_move(self, board_state: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        pass

    def validate_move(self, column: int, board_state: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        pass

    def reset_player(self) -> None:
        pass

    def get_name(self) -> str:
        pass

    def get_piece(self) -> int:
        pass

    def is_ai_player(self) -> bool:
        pass

    def get_score(self) -> int:
        pass

    def get_move_history(self) -> List[int]:
        pass

    def set_difficulty(self, difficulty: str) -> None:
        pass

    def get_difficulty(self) -> str:
        pass
