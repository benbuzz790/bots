Implement a 'game.py' file containing the main Connect Four game logic, including game state management and win condition checks.\n2. Create a 'board.py' file to represent the game board, its operations, and piece placement logic.\n3. Develop a 'player.py' file to manage player turns, moves, and basic AI for a computer opponent if applicable.\n4. Include unit tests within each Python file to ensure code functionality and correctness.\n5. Ensure all modules adhere to the project's size constraint (small, proof-of-concept level) and do not exceed 100 lines of code each.\nLocal goals: The 'src' directory serves as the core of the Connect Four game implementation. It contains the essential game logic, data structures, and utility functions necessary for the game's functionality. This directory aims to provide a clean, modular, and easily testable codebase for the Connect Four game, separate from the GUI implementation, while maintaining a small, proof-of-concept level project structure.\n\nProject Interfaces:\nParent: test@2024-08-10_21-07-26\nParent Requirements: \n        1. Keep the project SMALL. Proof-of-concept level. Ensure all modules have this requirement.\n        2. No more than 5 requirements can be placed on any directory.\n        3. Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
