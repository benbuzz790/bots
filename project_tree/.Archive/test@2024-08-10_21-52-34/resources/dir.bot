Store minimal graphical assets for game pieces and board representation.\n2. Include a simple configuration file for basic game settings (e.g., board size, colors).\n3. Maintain a clear and logical folder structure for easy resource management.\n4. Ensure all resources are lightweight, aligning with the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.\n5. Include a brief README file documenting the contents and purpose of the resources directory.\nLocal goals: The 'resources' directory serves as a centralized repository for all non-code assets essential to the Connect Four game. Its purpose is to organize and store graphical elements, configuration files, and any other static resources required by both the core game logic and the GUI components.

There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8.
