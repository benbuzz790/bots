Requirements:
1. Store minimal graphical assets for game pieces and board representation.
2. Include a simple configuration file for basic game settings (e.g., board size, colors).
3. Maintain a clear and logical folder structure for easy resource management.
4. Ensure all resources are lightweight, aligning with the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.
5. Include a brief README file documenting the contents and purpose of the resources directory.

Goals:
The 'resources' directory serves as a centralized repository for all non-code assets essential to the Connect Four game. Its purpose is to organize and store graphical elements, configuration files, and any other static resources required by both the core game logic and the GUI components. This directory aims to keep the project's assets well-organized and easily accessible.
