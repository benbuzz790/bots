Project Name: test@2024-08-10_21-52-34
Requirements:

        1. Keep the project SMALL. Proof-of-concept level. Ensure all modules have this requirement.
        2. No more than 5 requirements can be placed on any directory.
        3. Exactly three top level directories.
        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.
        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.
        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.
        7. No pop-ups.
        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.
        
Goals:
Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities
