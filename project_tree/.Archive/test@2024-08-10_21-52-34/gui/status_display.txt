Requirements:
1. Implement a status display area using a lightweight GUI framework compatible with the main window.
2. Create a method to update and display the current player's turn.
3. Implement functionality to show game outcome messages (win, draw) when the game ends.
4. Design a clear and visually appealing layout for status information.
5. Ensure the status display is responsive and updates in real-time with game state changes.
6. Implement color-coding or icons to distinguish between different players and game states.
7. Include accessibility features such as screen reader compatibility for status messages.
8. Provide methods for automated testing of status display updates without requiring user interaction.
9. Ensure all displayed elements have appropriate timeouts (< 1 second) during testing.
10. Include unit tests within the file to verify the functionality of the status display component.

Goals:
The status_display.py file is responsible for creating and managing the visual component that shows the current game status in the Connect Four GUI. Its primary purpose is to provide clear, real-time information about the game's progress, including the current player's turn, game outcome (win, draw, or ongoing), and any relevant messages or prompts. This component aims to enhance the user experience by keeping players informed about the game state and facilitating smooth gameplay.

Interface:
from typing import Optional

class StatusDisplay:
    def __init__(self, parent_widget: 'Widget'):
        pass

    def update_current_player(self, player: int) -> None:
        pass

    def show_game_outcome(self, outcome: str, winner: Optional[int] = None) -> None:
        pass

    def reset_display(self) -> None:
        pass

    def set_message(self, message: str) -> None:
        pass

    def clear_message(self) -> None:
        pass

    def set_test_mode(self, enabled: bool) -> None:
        pass

def create_status_display(parent_widget: 'Widget') -> StatusDisplay:
    pass
