Requirements:
1. Implement a comprehensive suite of automated tests for all GUI components (main window, game board, status display).
2. Create tests to verify the correct initialization and layout of GUI elements.
3. Implement tests for user interactions, such as column selection and game reset, without requiring actual user input.
4. Develop tests to validate the GUI's response to various game states (player turns, wins, draws).
5. Ensure all tests have timeouts of less than 1 second for interactive elements.
6. Implement tests to verify the scalability and responsiveness of the GUI components.
7. Create tests for accessibility features, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
8. Develop tests to validate error handling and edge cases in the GUI.
9. Implement tests to verify the correct updating of the game board and status display based on game logic.
10. Include tests for any animations or visual feedback mechanisms used in the GUI.

Goals:
The gui_tests.py file is responsible for implementing automated tests for the Connect Four game's graphical user interface. Its primary purpose is to ensure the reliability, functionality, and responsiveness of all GUI components, including the main window, game board, and status display. This file aims to validate the integration of GUI elements with the game logic, verify proper user interaction handling, and confirm that the GUI meets the specified requirements, all without requiring manual user intervention during testing.
