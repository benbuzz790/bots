Implement a main GUI window using a lightweight Python GUI framework.\n2. Create a visual representation of the Connect Four game board with clickable columns.\n3. Develop a game status display showing current player turn and game outcome.\n4. Implement automated GUI testing with <1 second timeouts for all interactive elements.\n5. Ensure no pop-ups are used in the GUI implementation.\nLocal goals: The 'gui' directory aims to create a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing graphical user interface for the Connect Four game. It serves as the bridge between the core game logic and the user, providing an interactive and engaging way to play the game. The GUI should be easily testable and maintain the project's small, proof-of-concept nature.\n\nProject Interfaces:\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_21-52-34\\src\\game.py Interface:\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\nclass ConnectFourGame:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def start_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def check_win(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def check_draw(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_current_player(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def get_board_state(self) -> Tuple[Tuple[int, ...], ...]:\n        pass\n\n    def reset_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\ndef run_game() -> None:\n    pass\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    run_game()\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_21-52-34\\src\\board.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\nclass Board:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def place_piece(self, column: int, player: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def is_valid_move(self, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def check_win(self, player: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def is_full(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def get_state(self) -> List[List[int]]:\n        pass\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\ndef create_board() -> Board:\n    pass\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_21-52-34\\src\\player.py Interface:\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, player_number: int, piece_color: str):\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_player_number(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def get_piece_color(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\n    def get_state(self) -> Tuple[int, int]:\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\nclass HumanPlayer(Player):\n    def get_move_input(self) -> int:\n        pass\n\ndef create_player(player_number: int, piece_color: str, is_human: bool = True) -> Player:\n    pass\n\nParent: test@2024-08-10_21-52-34\nParent Requirements: \n        1.

Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",

Implement tests for user interactions, such as column selection and game reset, without requiring actual user input.\n4. Develop tests to validate the GUI's response to various game states (player turns, wins, draws).\n5. Ensure all tests have timeouts of less than 1 second for interactive elements.\n6. Implement tests to verify the scalability and responsiveness of the GUI components.\n7. Create tests for accessibility features, including keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.\n8. Develop tests to validate error handling and edge cases in the GUI.\n9. Implement tests to verify the correct updating of the game board and status display based on game logic.\n10. Include tests for any animations or visual feedback mechanisms used in the GUI.\n\n        Respond with a code block containing only the interface specification.\n        ",
