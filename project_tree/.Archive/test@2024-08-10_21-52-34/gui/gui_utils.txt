Requirements:
1. Define a set of color constants for consistent use across all GUI components.
2. Implement utility functions for layout calculations, such as grid positioning and sizing.
3. Create helper functions for common GUI operations, like creating and configuring widgets.
4. Provide utility classes or functions for handling animations or visual effects.
5. Implement error handling utilities specific to GUI operations.
6. Create functions to assist with accessibility features, such as text-to-speech conversion.
7. Develop utilities for automated GUI testing, including methods to simulate user interactions.
8. Implement functions for managing timeouts in GUI elements during testing.
9. Provide utilities for scaling GUI elements based on window size or resolution.
10. Include unit tests for all utility functions to ensure their reliability.

Goals:
The gui_utils.py file serves as a utility module for the Connect Four game's graphical user interface. Its primary purpose is to provide common functions, constants, and helper classes that can be used across different GUI components. This file aims to promote code reusability, maintain consistency in the GUI implementation, and simplify the development and maintenance of the game's visual elements. It should offer tools for color management, layout calculations, and other shared functionalities that support the main window, game board, and status display components.
