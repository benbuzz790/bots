Requirements:
1. Implement a 'game.py' module containing the main game loop and core Connect Four logic.
2. Create a 'board.py' module to represent and manage the game board state.
3. Develop a 'player.py' module to handle player turns and moves.
4. Include unit tests within each Python file, covering all key functionalities.
5. Ensure all modules are kept small and adhere to the proof-of-concept level requirement.

Goals:
The 'src' directory aims to house the core game logic and data structures for the Connect Four game. It serves as the backbone of the project, providing a clean, modular, and easily testable implementation of the game mechanics. This directory focuses on the fundamental functionality of Connect Four, separate from the GUI, ensuring a solid foundation for the game's operation.
