Implement a 'game.py' module containing the main game loop and core Connect Four logic.\n2. Create a 'board.py' module to represent and manage the game board state.\n3. Develop a 'player.py' module to handle player turns and moves.\n4. Include unit tests within each Python file, covering all key functionalities.\n5. Ensure all modules are kept small and adhere to the proof-of-concept level requirement.\nLocal goals: The 'src' directory aims to house the core game logic and data structures for the Connect Four game. It serves as the backbone of the project, providing a clean, modular, and easily testable implementation of the game mechanics. This directory focuses on the fundamental functionality of Connect Four, separate from the GUI, ensuring a solid foundation for the game's operation.\n\nProject Interfaces:\nParent: test@2024-08-10_21-52-34\nParent Requirements: \n        1. Keep the project SMALL. Proof-of-concept level. Ensure all modules have this requirement.\n        2. No more than 5 requirements can be placed on any directory.\n        3. Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
