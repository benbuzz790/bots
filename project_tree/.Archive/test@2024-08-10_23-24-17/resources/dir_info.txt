Requirements:
1. Create an 'images' subdirectory:
   - Include basic game piece images (e.g., red and yellow circles)
   - Add a simple background image for the game board
   - Provide an icon image for the application window
   - Ensure all images are small in file size and in common formats (e.g., PNG)

2. Implement a 'config' subdirectory:
   - Create a 'settings.json' file for game configuration (e.g., board size, colors)
   - Include a 'default_config.py' module with fallback values
   - Ensure configuration files are easily editable and human-readable

3. Develop a 'resource_manager.py' module:
   - Implement functions to load and manage resources (images, config)
   - Include error handling for missing or corrupt resource files
   - Add unit tests for resource loading and management functions

4. Maintain version control for resources:
   - Use relative paths when referencing resources in the code
   - Implement a simple versioning system for tracking resource updates

5. Keep the resource directory small and focused:
   - Limit the number and size of assets to maintain a proof-of-concept scope
   - Prioritize essential resources over decorative elements

Goals:
The 'resources' directory aims to centralize and manage all non-code assets required for the Connect Four game. It should provide easy access to images, configuration files, and other static resources needed by the game, while keeping the project structure clean and organized.
