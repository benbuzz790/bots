Create an 'images' subdirectory:\n   - Include basic game piece images (e.g., red and yellow circles)\n   - Add a simple background image for the game board\n   - Provide an icon image for the application window\n   - Ensure all images are small in file size and in common formats (e.g., PNG)\n\n2. Implement a 'config' subdirectory:\n   - Create a 'settings.json' file for game configuration (e.g., board size, colors)\n   - Include a 'default_config.py' module with fallback values\n   - Ensure configuration files are easily editable and human-readable\n\n3. Develop a 'resource_manager.py' module:\n   - Implement functions to load and manage resources (images, config)\n   - Include error handling for missing or corrupt resource files\n   - Add unit tests for resource loading and management functions\n\n4. Maintain version control for resources:\n   - Use relative paths when referencing resources in the code\n   - Implement a simple versioning system for tracking resource updates\n\n5. Keep the resource directory small and focused:\n   - Limit the number and size of assets to maintain a proof-of-concept scope\n   - Prioritize essential resources over decorative elements\nLocal goals: The 'resources' directory aims to centralize and manage all non-code assets required for the Connect Four game. It should provide easy access to images, configuration files, and other static resources needed by the game, while keeping the project structure clean and organized.\n\nProject

Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
