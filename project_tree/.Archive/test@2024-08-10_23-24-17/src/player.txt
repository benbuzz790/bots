Requirements:
1. Implement a base Player class with essential attributes (e.g., name, piece color).
2. Create a HumanPlayer subclass for handling human player interactions.
3. Develop an AIPlayer subclass with a simple AI implementation for single-player mode.
4. Implement a method for players to make moves, compatible with the game's interface.
5. Include input validation for human player moves to ensure they are within the game rules.
6. Provide a simple AI strategy (e.g., random valid move selection) for the AIPlayer.
7. Implement a method to get the player's current state (e.g., name, color, type).
8. Ensure all classes and methods have clear, descriptive docstrings.
9. Create unit tests for all public methods of the Player classes.
10. Keep the total lines of code under 200, focusing on essential functionality.
11. Implement error handling for invalid player actions or inputs.
12. Ensure the AI player's decision-making process is separate from the move execution.
13. Provide a method to reset or initialize player state for new games.
14. Implement a string representation method for each player type.
15. Ensure compatibility with the Board and Game classes from other modules.

Goals:
The 'player.py' file aims to define and manage player entities in the Connect Four game. Its primary purpose is to encapsulate player-related functionality, including basic player attributes and decision-making logic for both human and AI players. This module should provide a flexible framework for player management, allowing easy integration with the main game logic and potential expansion for different player types or AI strategies in the future.

Interface:
from typing import List, Tuple
from board import Board

class Player:
    def __init__(self, name: str, color: int):
        pass

    def make_move(self, board: Board) -> int:
        pass

    def get_state(self) -> Tuple[str, int, str]:
        pass

    def reset(self) -> None:
        pass

    def __str__(self) -> str:
        pass

class HumanPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, name: str, color: int):
        pass

    def make_move(self, board: Board) -> int:
        pass

class AIPlayer(Player):
    def __init__(self, name: str, color: int):
        pass

    def make_move(self, board: Board) -> int:
        pass

def create_player(player_type: str, name: str, color: int) -> Player:
    pass
