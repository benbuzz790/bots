Implement a 'game.py' module with:\n   - Connect Four game logic (board representation, move validation, win checking)\n   - Player turn management\n   - Game state tracking\n   - Self-contained unit tests for all public methods\n\n2. Create a 'board.py' module containing:\n   - Board class with methods for piece placement and state queries\n   - Board visualization for console-based testing\n   - Unit tests covering all board operations\n\n3. Develop a 'player.py' module including:\n   - Player class with basic attributes (e.g., name, piece color)\n   - Simple AI player implementation for single-player mode\n   - Unit tests for player functionality\n\n4. Implement an 'utils.py' module with:\n   - Utility functions for input validation and error handling\n   - Any shared constants or enums\n   - Unit tests for all utility functions\n\n5. Ensure all modules adhere to the project's size constraints:\n   - Keep each module under 200 lines of code\n   - Prioritize essential functionality over advanced features\nLocal goals: The 'src' directory aims to contain the core game logic and functionality for the Connect Four game. It should provide a small, efficient, and easily testable implementation of the game mechanics, serving as the backbone for the GUI and overall project structure.\n\nProject Interfaces:\nParent: test@2024-08-10_23-24-17\nParent Requirements: \n        1. Keep the project SMALL. Proof-of-concept level. Ensure all modules have this requirement.\n        2. No more than 5 requirements can be placed on any directory.\n        3. Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
