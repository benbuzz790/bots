Requirements:
1. Implement a 'game.py' module with:
   - Connect Four game logic (board representation, move validation, win checking)
   - Player turn management
   - Game state tracking
   - Self-contained unit tests for all public methods

2. Create a 'board.py' module containing:
   - Board class with methods for piece placement and state queries
   - Board visualization for console-based testing
   - Unit tests covering all board operations

3. Develop a 'player.py' module including:
   - Player class with basic attributes (e.g., name, piece color)
   - Simple AI player implementation for single-player mode
   - Unit tests for player functionality

4. Implement an 'utils.py' module with:
   - Utility functions for input validation and error handling
   - Any shared constants or enums
   - Unit tests for all utility functions

5. Ensure all modules adhere to the project's size constraints:
   - Keep each module under 200 lines of code
   - Prioritize essential functionality over advanced features

Goals:
The 'src' directory aims to contain the core game logic and functionality for the Connect Four game. It should provide a small, efficient, and easily testable implementation of the game mechanics, serving as the backbone for the GUI and overall project structure.
