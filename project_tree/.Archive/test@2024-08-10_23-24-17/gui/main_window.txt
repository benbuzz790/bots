Requirements:
1. Implement a MainWindow class using a lightweight GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter)
2. Create methods to initialize and update the game board display
3. Implement functions to display and update player information and game status
4. Develop methods to handle user interactions and trigger appropriate game logic
5. Create a method to reset the game state and GUI elements
6. Implement a game loop that updates the GUI based on the current game state
7. Ensure all GUI updates are thread-safe and non-blocking
8. Implement programmatic methods to simulate user actions for testing purposes
9. Include timeout mechanisms (<1 second) for any elements requiring dismissal during testing
10. Integrate with the Game class from the src directory to manage game state
11. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all GUI components and interactions
12. Ensure no pop-up windows are used for any functionality
13. Implement error handling and display for invalid moves or unexpected states
14. Optimize performance to maintain responsiveness during gameplay and testing

Goals:
The main_window.py file serves as the central component of the Connect Four game's graphical user interface. Its primary purposes are:
1. Create and manage the main game window
2. Integrate and coordinate all GUI elements (board, menu, player info)
3. Handle the overall game flow and state management
4. Provide a seamless interface between the GUI and the core game logic
5. Ensure testability of all GUI components without user interaction

Interface:
from typing import Tuple
from src.game import Game

class MainWindow:
    def __init__(self, game: Game):
        pass

    def run(self) -> None:
        pass

    def update_display(self) -> None:
        pass

    def reset_game(self) -> None:
        pass

    def handle_move(self, column: int) -> None:
        pass

    def get_game_state(self) -> Tuple[str, str, bool]:
        pass

    def simulate_move(self, column: int) -> None:
        pass

    def simulate_reset(self) -> None:
        pass

def create_main_window(game: Game) -> MainWindow:
    pass

def run_gui_game() -> None:
    pass
