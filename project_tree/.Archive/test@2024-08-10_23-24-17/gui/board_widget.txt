Requirements:
1. Implement a BoardWidget class using a lightweight GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter)
2. Create a visual grid representation of the 7x6 Connect Four board
3. Implement methods to update the board display based on the current game state
4. Develop click handlers for user interaction with the board columns
5. Provide visual feedback for valid moves (e.g., highlighting the selected column)
6. Implement visual indicators for invalid moves (e.g., temporary color change)
7. Create a method to highlight winning combinations of pieces
8. Implement programmatic methods to simulate user clicks for testing purposes
9. Ensure all visual updates are thread-safe and non-blocking
10. Optimize rendering performance for smooth animations and transitions
11. Include a method to reset the board to its initial state
12. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all board interactions and displays
13. Ensure compatibility with different screen sizes and resolutions
14. Provide accessibility features (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
15. Implement error handling for unexpected game states or user actions

Goals:
The board_widget.py file is responsible for creating and managing the visual representation of the Connect Four game board within the GUI. Its primary purposes are:
1. Render an interactive game board that accurately reflects the current game state
2. Handle user input for piece placement on the board
3. Provide visual feedback for valid/invalid moves and win conditions
4. Offer a clean interface for integration with the main window and game logic
5. Ensure testability of all board interactions without requiring user input

Interface:
from typing import List, Tuple, Callable

class BoardWidget:
    def __init__(self, parent, width: int, height: int, on_click: Callable[[int], None]):
        pass

    def update_board(self, board_state: List[List[int]]) -> None:
        pass

    def highlight_column(self, column: int) -> None:
        pass

    def unhighlight_column(self, column: int) -> None:
        pass

    def show_invalid_move(self, column: int) -> None:
        pass

    def highlight_winning_combination(self, winning_positions: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:
        pass

    def reset_board(self) -> None:
        pass

    def simulate_click(self, column: int) -> None:
        pass

    def set_keyboard_navigation(self, enabled: bool) -> None:
        pass

    def get_current_state(self) -> List[List[int]]:
        pass

def create_board_widget(parent, width: int, height: int, on_click: Callable[[int], None]) -> BoardWidget:
    pass
