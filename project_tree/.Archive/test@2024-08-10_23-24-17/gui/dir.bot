Implement a 'main_window.py' module:\n   - Create the main game window using a lightweight GUI framework (e.g., Tkinter)\n   - Display the game board, player information, and game status\n   - Include methods for updating the GUI based on game state changes\n   - Implement self-contained unit tests for all GUI components\n\n2. Develop a 'board_widget.py' module:\n   - Create a visual representation of the Connect Four board\n   - Handle user input for piece placement\n   - Provide visual feedback for valid/invalid moves and win conditions\n   - Include unit tests that simulate user actions without requiring interaction\n\n3. Create a 'menu.py' module:\n   - Implement game controls (start, reset, quit) within the main window\n   - Avoid using pop-ups for any functionality\n   - Include unit tests for menu interactions\n\n4. Ensure all GUI elements are testable without user interaction:\n   - Implement programmatic methods to simulate clicks and inputs\n   - Use timeouts (<1 second) for any elements requiring dismissal during testing\n\n5. Integrate with the 'src' directory:\n   - Use game logic from 'src' to update GUI state\n   - Implement tests to verify correct integration with game logic\nLocal goals: The 'gui' directory aims to provide a simple, intuitive, and testable graphical user interface for the Connect Four game. It should integrate seamlessly with the core game logic from the 'src' directory while offering a visually appealing and interactive experience for players.\n\nProject Interfaces:\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_23-24-17\\src\\game.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom board import Board\nfrom player import Player\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self, player1: Player, player2: Player):\n        pass\n\n    def initialize_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def check_win(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def check_draw(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def reset_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def get_current_player(self) -> Player:\n        pass\n\n    def get_game_state(self) -> Tuple[Board, Player, bool, bool]:\n        pass\n\n    def play_game(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\ndef run_console_game() -> None:\n    pass\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_23-24-17\\src\\board.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\nBOARD_COLUMNS = 7\nBOARD_ROWS = 6\n\nclass Board:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pass\n\n    def place_piece(self, column: int, player: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def is_valid_move(self, column: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_cell(self, row: int, column: int) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def check_win(self, player: int) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\n    def get_board_state(self) -> List[List[int]]:\n        pass\n\n    def is_full(self) -> bool:\n        pass\n\n    def get_valid_moves(self) -> List[int]:\n        pass\n\ndef create_board() -> Board:\n    pass\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_23-24-17\\src\\player.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom board import Board\n\nclass Player:\n    def __init__(self, name: str, color: int):\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, board: Board) -> int:\n        pass\n\n    def get_state(self) -> Tuple[str, int, str]:\n        pass\n\n    def reset(self) -> None:\n        pass\n\n    def __str__(self) -> str:\n        pass\n\nclass HumanPlayer(Player):\n    def __init__(self, name: str, color: int):\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, board: Board) -> int:\n        pass\n\nclass AIPlayer(Player):\n    def __init__(self, name: str, color: int):\n        pass\n\n    def make_move(self, board: Board) -> int:\n        pass\n\ndef create_player(player_type: str, name: str, color: int) -> Player:\n    pass\n\nC:\\Users\\Ben Rinauto\\Documents\\Code\\llm-utilities-git\\llm-utilities\\.experiments\\test@2024-08-10_23-24-17\\src\\utils.py Interface:\nfrom typing import List, Dict, Any\nimport logging\n\n# Constants\nBOARD_ROWS: int\nBOARD_COLUMNS: int\nPLAYER_SYMBOLS: Dict[int, str]\n\n# Input validation\ndef validate_column_input(input_value: str) -> int:\n    pass\n\n# Error handling\nclass ConnectFourError(Exception):\n    pass\n\ndef handle_game_exception(error: Exception) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# Logging\ndef setup_logger() -> logging.Logger:\n    pass\n\n# Data conversion\ndef board_to_string(board: List[List[int]]) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# Game rule checks\ndef is_valid_move(board: List[List[int]], column: int) -> bool:\n    pass\n\n# AI utilities\ndef evaluate_board_state(board: List[List[int]], player: int) -> int:\n    pass\n\n# Message formatting\ndef format_game_message(message_type: str, **kwargs) -> str:\n    pass\n\n# Configuration management\ndef load_game_config(config_file: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    pass\n\n# Performance profiling\ndef profile_function(func: callable) -> callable:\n    pass\n\n# Testing utilities\ndef generate_random_board() -> List[List[int]]:\n    pass\n\n# File I/O\ndef save_game_state(game_state: Dict[str, Any], filename: str) -> None:\n    pass\n\ndef load_game_state(filename: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    pass\n\n# Random scenario generation\ndef generate_test_scenario() -> Dict[str, Any]:\n    pass\n\nParent: test@2024-08-10_23-24-17\nParent Requirements: \n        1. Keep the project SMALL. Proof-of-concept level. Ensure all modules have this requirement.\n        2. No more than 5 requirements can be placed on any directory.\n        3. Exactly three top level directories.\n        4. The subject of the test project - make a connect four game in python.\n        5. Testing: All python files will contain their own unittests. There will be no /tests folder - rather, tests that rely on more than one module should be built into the directory where those modules are used in conjunction.\n        6. The game should have a testable GUI. When testing the GUI, ensure that no user interaction is required. All GUI elements that require dismissal should have <1 second timeouts during testing, for instance, rather than requiring someone to click.\n        7. No pop-ups.\n        8. Requirements vs. Goals: All requirements should be testable. Goals do not have to be testable, but should memorialize the purpose of the requirements.\n        \nParent Goals: Create a small python project to demonstrate your capabilities\n\n\n        ",
