Requirements:
1. Implement a Menu class using the same GUI framework as the main window
2. Create buttons for essential game controls: Start New Game, Reset Game, and Quit
3. Implement methods to handle button click events and trigger appropriate actions
4. Ensure all menu interactions are performed within the main window (no pop-ups)
5. Develop programmatic methods to simulate button clicks for testing purposes
6. Implement keyboard shortcuts for menu actions (e.g., 'N' for New Game)
7. Create a method to enable/disable menu items based on the current game state
8. Implement visual feedback for button interactions (e.g., hover effects)
9. Ensure menu elements are responsive and adapt to different window sizes
10. Implement comprehensive unit tests for all menu interactions
11. Provide accessibility features for menu items (e.g., screen reader support)
12. Implement error handling for unexpected interactions or game states
13. Optimize menu rendering and interaction performance
14. Include a method to update menu item labels or states dynamically
15. Ensure thread-safety for all menu operations and updates

Goals:
The menu.py file is responsible for creating and managing the game control menu within the Connect Four GUI. Its primary purposes are:
1. Provide essential game controls (start, reset, quit) within the main window
2. Offer a user-friendly interface for game management
3. Integrate seamlessly with the main window and game logic
4. Ensure all menu interactions are testable without user input
5. Maintain a clean and non-intrusive design that complements the game board

Interface:
from typing import Callable

class Menu:
    def __init__(self, parent, new_game_callback: Callable[[], None], reset_game_callback: Callable[[], None], quit_callback: Callable[[], None]):
        pass

    def enable_item(self, item_name: str) -> None:
        pass

    def disable_item(self, item_name: str) -> None:
        pass

    def update_item_label(self, item_name: str, new_label: str) -> None:
        pass

    def simulate_click(self, item_name: str) -> None:
        pass

    def set_keyboard_shortcuts(self, enabled: bool) -> None:
        pass

    def get_menu_state(self) -> dict:
        pass

def create_menu(parent, new_game_callback: Callable[[], None], reset_game_callback: Callable[[], None], quit_callback: Callable[[], None]) -> Menu:
    pass
