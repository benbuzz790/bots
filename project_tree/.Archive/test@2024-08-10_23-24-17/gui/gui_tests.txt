Requirements:
1. Implement a comprehensive set of unit tests for MainWindow, BoardWidget, and Menu classes
2. Create integration tests to verify the correct interaction between GUI components and game logic
3. Develop tests that simulate user actions (clicks, keyboard inputs) without requiring actual user interaction
4. Implement tests for all game scenarios: new game, moves, wins, draws, resets, and quits
5. Create tests to verify the correct updating of GUI elements based on game state changes
6. Implement performance tests to ensure GUI responsiveness under different conditions
7. Develop tests for error handling and unexpected user inputs
8. Create tests to verify the correct implementation of accessibility features
9. Implement tests for different screen sizes and resolutions to ensure GUI adaptability
10. Develop tests to verify that no pop-ups are used in any part of the GUI
11. Create tests to ensure all GUI updates are thread-safe and non-blocking
12. Implement tests for timeout mechanisms (<1 second) for any elements requiring dismissal
13. Develop tests to verify the correct visual feedback for valid/invalid moves and win conditions
14. Create tests to ensure the GUI state is correctly reset when starting a new game
15. Implement a test runner that can execute all GUI tests without manual intervention

Goals:
The gui_tests.py file is responsible for comprehensive testing of the Connect Four GUI components. Its primary purposes are:
1. Ensure the reliability and correctness of all GUI elements (main window, board widget, menu)
2. Verify the integration between GUI components and the core game logic
3. Test user interactions and game flow without requiring manual input
4. Validate the GUI's responsiveness and performance under various scenarios
5. Provide a suite of automated tests that can be run as part of a continuous integration process
