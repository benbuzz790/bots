# Issue #162: Mojibake and Unicode Issues - RESOLUTION REPORT
## Summary
Issue #162 reported persistent mojibake (garbled Unicode characters) in source files across the codebase. After investigation, the root cause was identified as **existing mojibake in source files**, not a problem with the PowerShell or file I/O tools.
## Investigation Results
### 1. PowerShell Output Encoding - ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY
- Tested Unicode characters (→, ✅, ❌, •, …) through PowerShell
- All characters preserved correctly in output
- PowerShell is using UTF-8 encoding (code page 65001)
- No corruption during command execution
### 2. File Operations - ✅ WORKING CORRECTLY  
- Tested file write/read operations via PowerShell
- Unicode characters preserved correctly
- BOM (Byte Order Mark) is added by PowerShell's UTF8 encoding, but this is expected
- The clean_unicode_string() utility correctly removes BOMs
### 3. Source File Mojibake - ❌ FOUND AND FIXED
- **Location**: ots/dev/cli.py line 2410 (previously 2381)
- **Issue**: Arrow character was stored as mojibake â†' instead of →
- **Cause**: File was saved with incorrect encoding at some point in the past
- **Fix**: Replaced mojibake with correct Unicode character
## Changes Made
### Fixed Files
1. **bots/dev/cli.py** - Line 2410
   - Before: marker = "â†'" if i == 1 else " "
   - After: marker = "→" if i == 1 else " "
### Test Files Created
1. **tests/integration/test_unicode_mojibake_issue162.py**
   - Tests PowerShell Unicode preservation
   - Tests file operations with Unicode
   - All tests pass ✅
2. **tests/integration/test_bom_encoding_issue162.py**
   - Tests BOM handling
   - Tests PowerShell encoding settings
   - Confirms clean_unicode_string() works correctly
3. **tests/integration/test_bot_unicode_workflow_issue162.py**
   - Tests actual bot file operations
   - Confirms no mojibake in bot workflows
4. **tests/integration/test_mojibake_detection_issue162.py**
   - Scans source files for mojibake patterns
   - Verifies cli.py fix
   - Can be used for future mojibake detection
## Root Cause Analysis
The mojibake was **NOT** caused by:
- PowerShell output encoding issues
- File I/O operations
- BOM removal utilities
- The bot's file writing tools
The mojibake **WAS** caused by:
- Source files being saved with incorrect encoding in the past
- Likely copy-paste from terminal or editor encoding issues
- The mojibake was already present in committed files
## Recommendations
### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Fixed known mojibake in cli.py
2. ✅ Created detection test to prevent future issues
3. Run mojibake detection test in CI (optional)
### Prevention Measures
1. **Editor Configuration**: Add .editorconfig with charset = utf-8
2. **Git Attributes**: Ensure .gitattributes handles text files properly
3. **Pre-commit Hook**: Add mojibake detection (optional)
4. **Developer Guidelines**: Document proper encoding practices
### Future Monitoring
- Run test_mojibake_detection_issue162.py periodically
- The test scans all .py, .md, and .txt files for common mojibake patterns
- Can be integrated into CI pipeline
## Test Results
All tests pass:
- ✅ test_unicode_in_powershell_output
- ✅ test_unicode_in_file_operations  
- ✅ test_unicode_echo_command
- ✅ test_bom_in_powershell_file_creation
- ✅ test_clean_unicode_string_removes_bom
- ✅ test_powershell_output_encoding
- ✅ test_bot_file_write_with_unicode
- ✅ test_direct_python_file_write
- ✅ test_powershell_echo_to_file
- ✅ test_cli_arrow_fixed
## Conclusion
**Issue #162 is RESOLVED**. The mojibake was pre-existing in source files and has been fixed. The PowerShell and file I/O tools are working correctly and preserving Unicode as expected. The detection test will help prevent future mojibake from being introduced.
## Definition of Done - ✅ COMPLETE
