- Claude continues to forget that each code block is independent, and tries to use existing imports between code blocks.

- Claude occasionally tries to write new files using this format:

```epython
# filename.py
[code]
```

- Codey sometimes doesn't want to delete a file from the test directory, believes it to be an ethics test. I'm going to let that bug stay as a feature.
