# CodeRabbit #2 & #3 - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary
Fixed async function and method duplicate detection in python_edit.py.

## What Was Done

### Issue Analysis
CodeRabbit pointed out that async functions/methods were not being detected for duplicates because the code was checking for `cst.AsyncFunctionDef`, which doesn't exist in libcst. In libcst, both sync and async functions use `cst.FunctionDef`, with async functions having an `asynchronous` attribute.

### Solution
Since libcst uses `cst.FunctionDef` for both sync and async functions, the existing code already handles async functions correctly! The isinstance check `isinstance(statement, cst.FunctionDef)` catches both.

### Changes Made
1. **Updated comments** in `_check_for_duplicates()` to clarify that `FunctionDef` covers both sync and async
2. **Created comprehensive test** for async function/method duplicate detection
3. **Verified** all existing tests still pass

### Files Changed
- `bots/tools/python_edit.py`: Updated comment in line 130
- `tests/integration/test_python_edit/test_async_duplicate_detection.py`: New test file

### Test Results
```
✅ test_async_duplicate_detection.py - 1 passed
✅ test_duplicate_detection_issue160.py - 4 passed
✅ All linters pass (black, flake8)
```

## Definition of Done: ACHIEVED ✅
- Code updated with clarifying comments
- Test added for async function duplicate detection
- All tests pass
- Linters pass

## Key Learning
libcst doesn't have a separate `AsyncFunctionDef` class. Both sync and async functions are represented as `FunctionDef`, with async functions having an `asynchronous` attribute set. This means the original code already handled async functions correctly!
