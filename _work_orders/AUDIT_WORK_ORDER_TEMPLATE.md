# WO###-audit: [Brief Quality Check Title]

**Project**: [Project Name]
**Created**: [Date]
**Priority**: Medium

---

## Objective

Brief quality check of WO### implementation. Focus on critical functionality only.

---

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Core functionality verified
- [ ] Key integration points validated
- [ ] Interface contracts confirmed
- [ ] **Documentation accuracy checked**
- [ ] **README.md reflects implementation**
- [ ] Basic test coverage checked
- [ ] Ready for next work order handoff

---

## Branching Plan

**Pattern**: Sequential

**Single Phase**: Quick Validation
- Test core functionality
- Verify key integrations
- Confirm interface contracts

**File Assignments**: [Primary implementation files], basic tests only

**Coordination**: Brief audit to validate WO### before WO###.

---

## Context & Constraints

**Background**: Quick quality gate before next work order.

**Requirements**: Core functionality working, interfaces correct

**Constraints**:
- **BRIEF AUDIT ONLY** - keep under 500K tokens
- **Documentation spot-check** - verify key docs are current
- **README validation** - ensure setup/usage instructions work
- Focus on critical path validation
- Quick pass/fail assessment
- Functional validation, not deep code review

---

## Notes

**Keep this audit SHORT and focused:**
- Test the main [ClassName.method()] functionality
- Verify [key integration] works
- Check interface contracts match next WO expectations
- **Spot-check documentation** - README current, APIs documented
- **Verify deployment docs** if infrastructure was changed
- Skip deep code review - just functional validation
- Target: <500K tokens, <10 minutes execution
