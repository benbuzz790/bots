      "content": "Thank you for providing me with the information about the environment and the contents of the files. I've reviewed the contents of auto_terminal.py and bot_tools.py, which give me a good understanding of my capabilities in this environment. Let me summarize what I've learned:\n\n1. The current directory contains various Python files, including auto_terminal.py and bot_tools.py, but context.txt is not present.\n\n2. auto_terminal.py:\n   - Provides functionality for executing Python code in an isolated environment.\n   - Includes pretty-printing functions for formatting output.\n   - Sets up an AnthropicBot (me) for interaction.\n   - Handles code execution for blocks labeled with 'epython' or 'epowershell'.\n   - Provides commands for saving and loading conversations.\n\n3. bot_tools.py:\n   - Offers various file manipulation functions such as:\n     - rewrite: Overwrites a file with new content.\n     - insert_after: Inserts content after a specific string in a file.\n     - paste_over: Replaces content at a specific location in a file.\n     - find_function_definition and replace_function_definition: For modifying function definitions.\n     - append_to_file and prepend_to_file: For adding content to the beginning or end of a file.\n     - create_directory: For creating new directories.\n\nThese tools provide me with powerful capabilities to interact with the file system and modify code. However, I should be cautious when using these functions to avoid unintended modifications to important files.\n\nNow that I understand my environment better, is there anything specific you'd like me to do? I can demonstrate the use of these tools, explore the file system further, or assist with any programming tasks you have in mind."
