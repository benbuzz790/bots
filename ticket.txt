# TICKET: Manual Cleanup Required
## Action Required
Please manually delete the following directories when convenient (after closing this session):
1. .pytest_tmp - Currently locked by a process
2. All .pytest_tmp_* directories (session-specific temp dirs from testing)
## How to Delete
### Option 1: After Reboot
1. Restart your computer
2. Delete the directories
### Option 2: Using Command Prompt as Admin
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Navigate to: C:\Users\benbu\Code\repo_working\bots
3. Run: mdir /s /q .pytest_tmp
4. Run: or /d %i in (.pytest_tmp_*) do rmdir /s /q "%i"
### Option 3: Using PowerShell as Admin
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to: C:\Users\benbu\Code\repo_working\bots
3. Run: Remove-Item .pytest_tmp -Recurse -Force
4. Run: Get-ChildItem .pytest_tmp_* | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
### Option 4: Safe Mode
1. Boot into Safe Mode
2. Delete the directories manually
## Why This Is Needed
The .pytest_tmp directory is locked by a Windows process (likely a zombie pytest worker).
We've simplified the test infrastructure to not need monkey-patching, but we need a
clean slate to test the improvements.
## After Cleanup
Once deleted, the new test infrastructure will:
- Use pytest-xdist's native worker isolation
- Create per-worker directories (gw0/, gw1/, etc.) automatically
- Have no race conditions on directory creation
- Be ready for Phase 2: fixing file naming in setup_test_file
## Status
- Phase 1: Completed (removed monkey-patching) ✅
- Phase 2: Ready to implement (fix file naming) ⏸️
- Testing: Blocked until cleanup ❌
