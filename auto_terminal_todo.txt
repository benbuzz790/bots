TODO for auto_terminal.py fixes:

1. Fix IndentVisitor class:
   - Review the visit method in the IndentVisitor class
   - Ensure it's correctly adding indentation to function definitions
   - Remove or adjust the unexpected 'str' being added to the output

2. Correct pretty function:
   - Review the pretty function implementation
   - Ensure it's adding the expected indentation to multi-line messages
   - Verify that the indentation is being applied correctly for all lines after the first

3. Debug main function auto-mode:
   - Investigate why the respond method isn't being called in auto-mode
   - Ensure the auto-mode loop is being entered and executed correctly
   - Check if there are any early exit conditions preventing the loop from running

4. Update tests if necessary:
   - If any of the above changes result in intentional changes to behavior, update the corresponding tests
   - Ensure test expectations match the desired behavior of the functions

5. Additional testing:
   - Add more comprehensive tests for the IndentVisitor class
   - Create tests for edge cases in the pretty function
   - Expand auto-mode tests to cover different scenarios

6. Code review:
   - Once changes are made, perform a thorough code review
   - Ensure all modifications align with the overall design and purpose of auto_terminal.py

7. Documentation:
   - Update any relevant documentation to reflect changes made
   - Add inline comments to explain any complex logic, especially in the IndentVisitor class

8. Performance check:
   - After fixes, run performance tests to ensure no significant slowdowns were introduced

Remember to test each change individually and run the full test suite after each modification to ensure no regressions are introduced.
